1
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,440
My top reasons for applying Edinburgh
were because I loved the vibe of the city.

2
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,000
It's a very vibrant city
and it's super accepting and welcoming

3
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,680
and the community feel in Edinburgh
is really strong and I really love that.

4
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:36,600
Additionally, the course I do is pretty
niche so my options were kind of limited.

5
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,600
But I knew Edinburgh was the place
I definitely wanted live and study.

6
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,320
And finally,
Edinburgh is a Russell Group university

7
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,440
and I knew
I wanted study at a top University

8
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,880
because it offers me
with brilliant research opportunities

9
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,240
that I wouldn't
necessarily get at other universities.

10
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,920
My top three reasons
for applying Edinburgh are

11
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,040
the high quality of education
offered, the diversity,

12
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,240
the welcoming student community
and the numerous opportunities

13
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,760
get involved
inextracurricular activities.

14
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,880
So the reasons I chose Edinburgh over
my other offers

15
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,320
was because firstly it’s
a very academically prestigious uni.

16
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,600
I thought it would

17
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,520
look good for future employment prospects.

18
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,040
Secondly,
it's a lovely city, there’s so much do.

19
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,080
Thirdly, I live near London at home
and I just wanted a change of scenery and

20
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,080
experience a different kind of culture
which I felt like Edinburgh offers.

21
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,000
I fell in love with Edinburgh
the moment I stepped off the train

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,720
at Waverley train station.

23
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,440
It just so happened

24
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,480
that we pulled in at the exact
right moment and the weather was perfect,

25
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,520
and I remember walking down Princes
Street the hotel where I was staying

26
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,600
and watching this gorgeous,
gorgeous sunset over the Edinburgh Castle,

27
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,400
and I just knew that I wanted be here.

28
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,480
And then I went the open day
the next day, and it was gorgeous.

29
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,200
I loved the campus,
I loved the test lecture.

30
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,000
It was just brilliant.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,040
And I, I knew in that moment

32
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,920
that this is where I want spend
the next four years of my life.

33
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,160
So Edinburgh, in three words for me,

34
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,760
would be wholesome,
welcoming and motivating.

35
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:19,000
Historic, mysterious and charming.

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,360
Buzzing, idyllic,
and enriching.

37
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,360
Historic, diverse and accepting.

38
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,920
Vibrant, beautiful

39
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,920
and cold.

40
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,880
My three favourite places in Edinburgh

41
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,960
would be the Meadows because it’s a lovely
green open space, very picturesque.

42
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:50,600
Secondly, it would be Portobello Beach
because it just makes you feel, apart

43
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,640
from in the winter, iin the summer
it makes you feel like you're on holiday.

44
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,800
And thirdly, Princes Street,
just because it's a bustling city vibe.

45
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,200
And I think those three places
kind of really define Edinburgh.

46
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,840
My top three places hang out with
my friends would be one The Meadows,

47
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,280
because it's so close the university
and it has such a good, clean environment.

48
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,280
You could always go there,
sit by a tree, read a book, play Frisbee

49
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,760
with your friends. It is so much fun.

50
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,360
And my second place would be Teviot
because it's right

51
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,880
at the university campus.

52
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,280
And sometimes you just want take
a break of your studies and just go there,

53
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,200
sit, have a drink with your friends.

54
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:33,120
You could also study there because it has
an amphitheatre there, which is very new.

55
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,480
And my third place would be

56
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,840
Princes Street
because sometimes I like going there,

57
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,640
especially during Christmas times
when they have the Christmas market.

58
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,480
It's just really good go
hang out with your friends there.

59
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,400
I love that Edinburgh is a capital city
that isn't actually too big.

60
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,720
It combines all of the wonderful things
like having loads of things do,

61
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,520
the museums, the galleries,
the shops, the restaurants, the cafés

62
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:09,240
and yet you don’t really get lost
because it does still feel quite small.

63
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,000
And I think that Edinburgh is the perfect
combination of those two things

64
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,720
I love the mix of old
and new in Edinburgh.

65
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,800
The city is home centuries
old landmarks and a vibrant,

66
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,120
bustling atmosphere
full of energy and life.

67
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,640
That is something I really love
about Edinburgh.

68
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,680
It is truly unique and a very special city

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,800
and it'll always be close my heart.

70
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,160
What I love most about Edinburgh is 100%
the nature.

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,280
There is so many opportunities
here around Edinburgh

72
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,960
explore, hike, camp, boulder.

73
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,680
It's amazing.

74
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,240
Only 30 minutes of transport
and you're in on a beautiful coastline

75
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:54,640
in the Pentland and the Cairngorms
in a forest in Dalkeith and an old abbey.

76
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,760
It's really amazing.

77
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,560
I've been here four years
and I've never run out of weekend

78
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,400
or day trips around Edinburgh
and in the nature,

79
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,480
and I think that's really, really amazing.

80
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,360
The weather in Edinburgh is unpredictable.

81
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:20,800
Coming from a tropical country,
I think Edinburgh is cold

82
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,960
and it can be windy and it can be rainy.

83
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,640
The best thing that you can do
is be prepared for any kind of weather.

84
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,920
If you want experience
all four seasons in one day.

85
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,160
I think Edinburgh is the city for it.

86
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,560
So contrary common opinion,
I really think Edinburgh is very sunny.

87
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,400
Don't be put off by all those rumours
that it rains all the time.

88
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,480
Honestly, it's always the perfect weather

89
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,640
go on a hike
explore the nature around Edinburgh,

90
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,360
and if it does rain a bit,
I think it creates a really cool,

91
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,560
misty vibe

92
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,760
where you just want go and sit
in a café and be at home with a hot

93
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:04,440
chocolate and it really doesn't hurt
have a bit of rain once in a while.
