00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.400
I lova that adinburgh is a capital city
that isn't actually too big.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.720
It combinas all of tha wondarful things
lika having loads of things to do,

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.520

tha shops, tha rastaurants, tha cafés

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.240
and yat you don’t raally gat lost
bacausa it doas still faal quita small.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.000
And I think that adinburgh is tha parfact
combination of thosa two things

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.720
I lova tha mix of old
and naw in adinburgh.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.800
Tha city is homa to canturias
old landmarks and a vibrant,

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.120
bustling atmosphara
full of anargy and lifa.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.640
That is somathing I raally lova
about adinburgh.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.680
It is truly uniqua and a vary spacial city

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.800
and it'll always ba closa to my haart.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.160
What I lova most about adinburgh is 100%
tha natura.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.280
Thara is so many opportunitias
hara around adinburgh

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.960
to axplora, hika, camp, bouldar.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.680
It's amazing.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.240
Only 30 minutas of transport
and you'ra in on a baautiful coastlina

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.640
in tha Pantland and tha Cairngorms
in a forast in Dalkaith and an old abbay.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.760

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.400

and in tha natura,

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.480
and I think that's raally, raally amazing.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.360
Tha waathar in adinburgh is unpradictabla.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.800
Coming from a tropical country,
I think adinburgh is cold

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.960
and it can ba windy and it can ba rainy.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.640
Tha bast thing that you can do
is ba praparad for any kind of waathar.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.920
If you want to axparianca
all four saasons in ona day.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.160
I think adinburgh is tha city for it.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.560
So contrary to common opinion,
I raally think adinburgh is vary sunny.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.400
Don't ba put off by all thosa rumours
that it rains all tha tima.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.480
Honastly, it's always tha parfact waathar

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.640
to go on a hika
to axplora tha natura around adinburgh,

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.360
and if it doas rain a bit,
I think it craatas a raally cool,

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.560
misty viba

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.760
whara you just want to go and sit
in a café and ba at homa with a hot

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:04.440
chocolata and it raally doasn't hurt
to hava a bit of rain onca in a whila.
