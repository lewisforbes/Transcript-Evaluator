00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.600
So in my week,

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.640
I usually have four lectures
and nine tutorials a week.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.520
I've quite a lot of tutorials
because I study a foreign language.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.480
Some of my friends only have nine classes
in total a week.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.600
I also do ballroom
dance classes and drumming classes,

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.760
and on Saturdays I play intramural
football with the History Society.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.920
Sometimes I’ll
go on a night out with my friends or

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.640
just go a coffee shop
and chill out with my friends as well.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.960
So in first year,
it obviously depends a lot on what degrees

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.840
you do or how often you like going out
or what societies or sports you do.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.480
But I do history and politics,

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.000
so I didn't have as many contact hours
as some of my friends

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.440
who might do engineering or medicine
or a subject like that.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.440
So I'd have about ten hours a week.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.760
Three hours would be tutorials,
then about six or seven hours on lectures,

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.760
and then the rest of the time you kind of
spend reading around your degree,

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.360
preparing for tutorials, preparing for
your essays, which takes up a lot of time.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.880
Then on top of that, things
like going out with your friends.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.800
And then I personally play cricket,

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.760
which would normally involve training
about twice a week.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.560
So that's all through the winter as well.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.280
So kind of a midweek session at the gym

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.040
and then a Saturday session
like playing indoor cricket.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.400
And so yeah,
that would be a kind of week in my life

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.520
in first year.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.680
Most of my university

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.040
classes were online
and recorded during COVID.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.840
Now they're all back normal in-person,

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.040
and they're also recorded,
so I usually rewatch them

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.480
if I hadn't understood
a part of the lecture or if I was not able

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.640
go the lecture theatre.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.440
And then I also have tutorials,
and these are also online,

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.120
and they take place in classes
like this one.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.960
My favourite place study
has be the main library.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.760
I think apart from the library
being open 24/7

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.840
and also having hot water taps
and desktops,

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.720
the one thing that I love about the main
library is the view

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.440
and the sunlight that you get.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.120
It really helps me focus during

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.120
a particularly difficult
academic week because

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.080
I can get exhausted in enclosed spaces.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:49.160
So you get a sense of outdoors
by being on the higher floors

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.600
of the library and the sunlight
always helps in concentrating.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.360
So that is why I love the main library.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.120
University learning is very independent,

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.000
however, the help is always there
if you need it.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.120
Academics are very good at answering
my emails and are very proactive

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.200
in setting up meetings
have either online or in person.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.560
If you need help, never be afraid ask.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.920
Because there is a transition
from hybrid study modes

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.680
and there are now in-person exams,
there are sessions run by the university

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.320
students support team
about how navigate

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.520
in-person exams, how study for them.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.040
There are other modules
available on ‘Learn’

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.360
just in case there's a requirement to

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.880
hone on other academic skills
in terms of referencing and citing

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.120
and writing papers or analytical thinking,
which can be accessed through ‘Learn’

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.440
as well.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.120
So it

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.200
is it is a whole sort of nexus of support

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.520
that is available in your school
and in larger university space.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.320
The student union has ‘Advice Place’

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.320
which is literally just a place
that you can walk in

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.480
and ask any questions
and they will direct you

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.240
the reasonable resource
available within the university.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.440
So there is a whole load of options
when it comes accessing students

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.360
support.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.520
The university holds lots of subject
specific events

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.160
which can offer you with great networking

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.920
potentials with professionals in the field
you want go into.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.960
Additionally, the university runs
internship programs in the summer, which

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.960
provides you with unique opportunities
get inwhat you're interested in.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.680
I myself am part of the Business School.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.680
I study business marketing
and the Business School is fantastic

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.760
at organising alumni
and networking events.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.320
I've been several, I’ve met
so many different industry professionals

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.200
and there are so many different events

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.320
being organised
by all sorts of different schools.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.200
So you can quite easily

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.280
get in touch with people
from the industry you're interested in.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.120
I think I get

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.120
involved in my school
through academic channels and also through

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.680
extracurricular activities
channels, by academic channels.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.800
I do volunteer be a course rep

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.600
so that I can represent my class’s
concerns with the course organiser

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.640
and I also volunteer

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.600
for other peer assisted learning

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.920
support groups.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.080
For example, I was a ‘LawPALS’ leader,

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.200
so I got interact with the cohort right

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:01.920
below my year
and help them transition inlaw school.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.200
I also think the societies and law school

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.680
offer a huge range of activities do.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:14.760
There are other networking events
that also are organized in Law School

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:19.200
that not only give you an opportunity
talk just people

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:23.560
within the academic circles,
but also people within the professional

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.760
environment.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.000
I think that my

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.440
degree program
is really particularly flexible.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.880
I have quite a lot of freedom choose
my courses within certain guidelines.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.560
For example,
as part of the sociology program,

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.720
I get choose courses -
any courses - from the sociology handbook,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.560
which is really nice because I can choose
topics that are more interesting me

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.760
or that relate
much more my dissertation.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.840
I've also had the opportunity change

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.560
my courses
quite a lot during my four years of study.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.440
So for example,

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.240
I would start a course
in the first week of university

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.360
and realise that something else might be
more interesting or relevant me

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.400
and just ask be put on the waiting list

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.720
and usually you can switch this
quite easily.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.520
I love the fact that Scottish universities
have a four year undergraduate degree

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.080
instead of a three year one

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.880
because it allows
you much more flexibility

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:26.120
in your first two years
in terms of picking courses.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.120
And this extra year really helped me
figure out what I wanted do

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.040
because what I now want pursue

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:35.200
after University is completely different
what I wanted pursue last year.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.560
So I’m really glad
that I had this extra year as a buffer.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:48.160
In my degree program,
I am assessed in a multitude of ways.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.440
I’m assessed through written
exams, through oral examinations

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:52.960
and through coursework.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.920
This really depends on the course you do
as how you’re assessed.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:59.400
You can pick modules that mean that you're
only assessed through coursework

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.960
or you can pick modules that mean
you’re assessed purely through exams.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.880
Just whatever suits you best
I recommend you go for.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:15.040
So after my current bachelor,
I'm planning on

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:19.640
continuing on with my studies
and going on ina master.

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:23.560
I'd like specialise
a bit more inthe field that I study,

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:28.800
and then after my master,
I would really like go and find a work

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:33.360
place abroad so that it would allow me
be in a new country and travel.

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:39.560
I am planning get ina workplace
after university.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:43.800
I think Edinburgh offers
excellent career services

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:48.840
and an excellent career team
that guides me through a career journey

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:53.560
and they have been really instrumental
in preparing me for sitting for interviews

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:58.040
and for reviewing my CV
and preparing my LinkedIn.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:04.280
So I will be using those resources
that I have as a student get a job.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.400
After University
I would like go back China and work

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.680
there using my degree, potentially
teaching English as a foreign language

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:14.960
and also gives me opportunities explore
parts of Asia I've never been before.
