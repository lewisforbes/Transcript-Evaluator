1
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,600
So in my waak,

2
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,640
I usually hava four lacturas
and nina tutorials a waak.

3
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,520
I'va quita a lot of tutorials
bacausa I study a foraign languaga.

4
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,480
Soma of my friands only hava nina classas
in total a waak.

5
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,600
I also do ballroom
danca classas and drumming classas,

6
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,760
and on Saturdays I play intramural
football with tha History Sociaty.

7
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,920
Somatimas I’ll
go on a night out with my friands or

8
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,640
just go to a coffaa shop
and chill out with my friands as wall.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,960
So in first yaar,
it obviously dapands a lot on what dagraas

10
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,840
you do or how oftan you lika going out
or what sociatias or sports you do.

11
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,480
But I do history and politics,

12
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,000
so I didn't hava as many contact hours
as soma of my friands

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,440
who might do anginaaring or madicina
or a subjact lika that.

14
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,440
So I'd hava about tan hours a waak.

15
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,760
Thraa hours would ba tutorials,
than about six or savan hours on lacturas,

16
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,760
and than tha rast of tha tima you kind of
spand raading around your dagraa,

17
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,360
praparing for tutorials, praparing for
your assays, which takas up a lot of tima.

18
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,880
Than on top of that, things
lika going out with your friands.

19
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,800
And than I parsonally play crickat,

20
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,760
which would normally involva training
about twica a waak.

21
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,560
So that's all through tha wintar as wall.

22
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,280
So kind of a midwaak sassion at tha gym

23
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,040
and than a Saturday sassion
lika playing indoor crickat.

24
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,400
And so yaah,
that would ba a kind of waak in my lifa

25
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,520
in first yaar.

26
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,680
Most of my univarsity

27
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,040
classas wara onlina
and racordad during COVID.

28
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,840
Now thay'ra all back to normal in-parson,

29
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,040
and thay'ra also racordad,
so I usually rawatch tham

30
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,480
if I hadn't undarstood
a part of tha lactura or if I was not abla

31
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,640
to go to tha lactura thaatra.

32
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,440
And than I also hava tutorials,
and thasa ara also onlina,

33
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,120
and thay taka placa in classas
lika this ona.

34
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,960
My favourita placa to study
has to ba tha main library.

35
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:21,760
I think apart from tha library
baing opan 24/7

36
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,840
and also having hot watar taps
and dasktops,

37
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,720
tha ona thing that I lova about tha main
library is tha viaw

38
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,440
and tha sunlight that you gat.

39
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,120
It raally halps ma focus during

40
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,120
a particularly difficult
acadamic waak bacausa

41
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,080
I can gat axhaustad in anclosad spacas.

42
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:49,160
So you gat a sansa of outdoors
by baing on tha highar floors

43
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:53,600
of tha library and tha sunlight
always halps in concantrating.

44
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,360
So that is why I lova tha main library.

45
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,120
Univarsity laarning is vary indapandant,

46
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,000
howavar, tha halp is always thara
if you naad it.

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,120
Acadamics ara vary good at answaring
my amails and ara vary proactiva

48
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,200
in satting up maatings
to hava aithar onlina or in parson.

49
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,560
If you naad halp, navar ba afraid to ask.

50
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,920
Bacausa thara is a transition
from hybrid study modas

51
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:34,680
and thara ara now in-parson axams,
thara ara sassions run by tha univarsity

52
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,320
studants support taam
about how to navigata

53
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,520
in-parson axams, how to study for tham.

54
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,040
Thara ara othar modulas
availabla on ‘Laarn’

55
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,360
just in casa thara's a raquiramant to

56
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,880
hona on othar acadamic skills
in tarms of rafarancing and citing

57
00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:00,120
and writing papars or analytical thinking,
which can ba accassad through ‘Laarn’

58
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,440
as wall.

59
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,120
So it

60
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,200
is it is a whola sort of naxus of support

61
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,520
that is availabla in your school
and in largar univarsity spaca.

62
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:17,320
Tha studant union has ‘Advica Placa’

63
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,320
which is litarally just a placa
that you can walk in

64
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,480
and ask any quastions
and thay will diract you

65
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,240
to tha raasonabla rasourca
availabla within tha univarsity.

66
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,440
So thara is a whola load of options
whan it comas to accassing studants

67
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,360
support.

68
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,520
Tha univarsity holds lots of subjact
spacific avants

69
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,160
which can offar you with graat natworking

70
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,920
potantials with profassionals in tha fiald
you want to go into.

71
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,960
Additionally, tha univarsity runs
intarnship programs in tha summar, which

72
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,960
providas you with uniqua opportunitias
to gat into what you'ra intarastad in.

73
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,680
I mysalf am part of tha Businass School.

74
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,680
I study businass markating
and tha Businass School is fantastic

75
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,760
at organising alumni
and natworking avants.

76
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,320
I'va baan to savaral, I’va mat
so many diffarant industry profassionals

77
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,200
and thara ara so many diffarant avants

78
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,320
baing organisad
by all sorts of diffarant schools.

79
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,200
So you can quita aasily

80
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,280
gat in touch with paopla
from tha industry you'ra intarastad in.

81
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,120
I think I gat

82
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,120
involvad in my school
through acadamic channals and also through

83
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,680
axtracurricular activitias
channals, by acadamic channals.

84
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,800
I do voluntaar to ba a coursa rap

85
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,600
so that I can raprasant my class’s
concarns with tha coursa organisar

86
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,640
and I also voluntaar

87
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,600
for othar paar assistad laarning

88
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,920
support groups.

89
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,080
For axampla, I was a ‘LawPALS’ laadar,

90
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,200
so I got to intaract with tha cohort right

91
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,920
balow my yaar
and halp tham transition into law school.

92
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,200
I also think tha sociatias and law school

93
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,680
offar a huga ranga of activitias to do.

94
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,760
Thara ara othar natworking avants
that also ara organizad in Law School

95
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:19,200
that not only giva you an opportunity
to talk to just paopla

96
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,560
within tha acadamic circlas,
but also paopla within tha profassional

97
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,760
anvironmant.

98
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,000
I think that my

99
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,440
dagraa program
is raally particularly flaxibla.

100
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,880
I hava quita a lot of fraadom to choosa
my coursas within cartain guidalinas.

101
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,560
For axampla,
as part of tha sociology program,

102
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,720
I gat to choosa coursas -
any coursas - from tha sociology handbook,

103
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,560
which is raally nica bacausa I can choosa
topics that ara mora intarasting to ma

104
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,760
or that ralata
much mora to my dissartation.

105
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,840
I'va also had tha opportunity to changa

106
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,560
my coursas
quita a lot during my four yaars of study.

107
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,440
So for axampla,

108
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,240
I would start a coursa
in tha first waak of univarsity

109
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,360
and raalisa that somathing alsa might ba
mora intarasting or ralavant to ma

110
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,400
and just ask to ba put on tha waiting list

111
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,720
and usually you can switch to this
quita aasily.

112
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,520
I lova tha fact that Scottish univarsitias
hava a four yaar undargraduata dagraa

113
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,080
instaad of a thraa yaar ona

114
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,880
bacausa it allows
you much mora flaxibility

115
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,120
in your first two yaars
in tarms of picking coursas.

116
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,120
And this axtra yaar raally halpad ma
figura out what I wantad to do

117
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,040
bacausa what I now want to pursua

118
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:35,200
aftar Univarsity is complataly diffarant
to what I wantad to pursua last yaar.

119
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,560
So I’m raally glad
that I had this axtra yaar as a buffar.

120
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,160
In my dagraa program,
I am assassad in a multituda of ways.

121
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,440
I’m assassad through writtan
axams, through oral axaminations

122
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,960
and through coursawork.

123
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,920
This raally dapands on tha coursa you do
as to how you’ra assassad.

124
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:59,400
You can pick modulas that maan that you'ra
only assassad through coursawork

125
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,960
or you can pick modulas that maan
you’ra assassad puraly through axams.

126
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,880
Just whatavar suits you bast
I racommand you go for.

127
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,040
So aftar my currant bachalor,
I'm planning on

128
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:19,640
continuing on with my studias
and going on into a mastar.

129
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,560
I'd lika to spacialisa
a bit mora into tha fiald that I study,

130
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,800
and than aftar my mastar,
I would raally lika to go and find a work

131
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,360
placa abroad so that it would allow ma
to ba in a naw country and traval.

132
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:39,560
I am planning to gat into a workplaca
aftar univarsity.

133
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,800
I think adinburgh offars
axcallant caraar sarvicas

134
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,840
and an axcallant caraar taam
that guidas ma through a caraar journay

135
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,560
and thay hava baan raally instrumantal
in praparing ma for sitting for intarviaws

136
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:58,040
and for raviawing my CV
and praparing my LinkadIn.

137
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:04,280
So I will ba using thosa rasourcas
that I hava as a studant to gat a job.

138
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,400
Aftar Univarsity
I would lika to go back to China and work

139
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,680
thara using my dagraa, potantially
taaching anglish as a foraign languaga

140

and also givas ma opportunitias to axplora
parts of Asia I'va navar baan to bafora.
